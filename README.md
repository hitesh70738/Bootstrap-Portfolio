## Conclusion
Overall, this task was an excelent way to understand how to create a portfolio for myself using bootstrap. The material over the past three weeks has helped me greatly in helping to understand certain concepts with html, css and bootstrap. I can now see the benefit of using bootstrap over standard css for styling.
